    <h2 id="what-is-photosynthesis">What is Photosynthesis?</h2>
    <p>
        Photosynthesis is the amazing process by which plants make their own food with the help of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. In this intricate dance, plants grab sunlight with their leaves and convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the earth into energy-rich sustenance. As a consequence, oxygen is released to the air, playing a vital role for other living beings. This process is very important for life on Earth as it supplies food and oxygen to countless organisms.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
    <p>
        Photosynthesis happens in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, where sunlight is absorbed to produce energy molecules, and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), where the plant uses that energy to turn carbon dioxide into sugars it can use as food.
    </p>

    <h3 id="phase-1-title">Phase 1: The Light-Dependent Reactions</h3>
    <p>
        In the first phase of photosynthesis, called the light-dependent reactions, plants capture sunlight in their chloroplasts. This energy splits water molecules, releasing oxygen. The excited electrons from the light energy travel through an electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient that powers the production of ATP. These high-energy electrons are also used to form NADPH. Both ATP and NADPH are then used in the next phase to help the plant make food. This phase is all about turning sunlight into usable energy for the plant.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Photon Absorption</strong><br>
            Light energy (photons) is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. This excites electrons in the chlorophyll, increasing their energy.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Water Splitting (Photolysis)</strong><br>
            The excited electrons are passed through the electron transport chain. To replace the lost electrons, water molecules are split into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and electrons. This occurs in the photosystem II complex. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Electron Transport Chain</strong><br>
            High-energy electrons move through a series of proteins embedded in the thylakoid membrane (electron transport chain). As electrons pass through, they release energy that is used to pump protons (H⁺) across the membrane, creating a proton gradient.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>ATP Synthesis</strong><br>
            The proton gradient created by the electron transport chain drives the enzyme ATP synthase. Protons flow back through ATP synthase, which uses their energy to convert ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) into ATP.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>NADPH Formation</strong><br>
            Electrons from the electron transport chain are transferred to NADP⁺, forming NADPH (a carrier molecule). NADPH is used in the next phase (the Calvin cycle) to help convert carbon dioxide into glucose.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>ATP and NADPH Storage</strong><br>
            The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are then used in the second phase of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), to synthesize sugars and other compounds.
        </li>
        <br>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="phase-2-title">Phase 2: The Light-Independent Reactions</h3>
    <p>
        In the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, the plant uses carbon dioxide from the air to make food. First, carbon dioxide is attached to a molecule called RuBP, creating a temporary 6-carbon compound that quickly splits into two 3-carbon molecules. Next, ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions are used to convert these molecules into a 3-carbon sugar called G3P. Some of the G3P is used to regenerate RuBP so the cycle can continue, while the rest is used to form glucose, which the plant uses for energy and growth. This phase doesn't need light to happen, but it relies on the energy produced in the light-dependent reactions.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Carbon Fixation:</strong><br>
            Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air is attached to a 5-carbon molecule called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO, forming a 6-carbon compound that quickly breaks down into two 3-carbon molecules.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Reduction:</strong><br>
            The 3-carbon molecules (3-PGA) are converted into molecules of G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) using ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Regeneration of RuBP:</strong><br>
            Some of the G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, which is necessary for the cycle to continue. This process also requires ATP.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Production of Glucose:</strong><br>
            The remaining G3P molecules are used to form glucose and other carbohydrates, which the plant can use for energy and growth.
        </li>
